# Interaction Programming

Code for Interaction Programming course at KTH 2016.

LAB1 NOTES:
-added landing page (home.html), which to be renamed as index.html later
-added select dish page. I didn't divide the views and screens like eplained during the lecture, since it's too much work without Angular and wasn't required in this lab.
